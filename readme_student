# MLOps NGINX Exam

## Overview

This project deploys a Machine Learning API using Nginx as a secure reverse proxy.

Features:

* Reverse proxy with Nginx
* Load balancing (api-v1, 3 replicas via scaling command)
* HTTPS with self-signed certificate
* Basic authentication on `/predict`
* Rate limiting
* A/B routing to api-v2 using header `X-Experiment-Group: debug`
* Monitoring with Prometheus and Grafana

## Start

Load balancing is enabled by scaling api-v1:

make start-project

(This runs docker compose with --scale api-v1=3)

## Test

make test

## Access

Prediction endpoint:
https://localhost:8443/predict

Monitoring:

* Prometheus: http://localhost:9090
* Grafana: http://localhost:3000
